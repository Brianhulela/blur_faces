# Face Detection and Blurring with OpenCV

[Cover Image](https://github.com/Brianhulela/blur_faces/blob/master/blur_faces_cover.drawio.png)

This project demonstrates how to automatically detect faces in an image and apply a Gaussian blur to protect privacy using Python and OpenCV.

## Overview

The main goal of this project is to help users anonymize faces in images by detecting and blurring them. OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier is used to detect faces, while Gaussian blur is applied to the detected regions.

## Features

- Detect faces in images using OpenCV.
- Apply Gaussian blur to protect the privacy of individuals in photos.
- Easy-to-follow implementation for beginners in Python.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Brianhulela/blur_faces
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
```
cd blur_faces
```

3. Install the required libraries:
```
pip install matplotlib opencv-python
```


## Usage

1. Place your image in the project directory.
2. Update the `imagePath` variable in the code to point to your image file.
3. Run the script to see the output with blurred faces.
